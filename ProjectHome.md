## About Sgine ##

Sgine is an application engine aimed at high performance interactive applications that use 3D graphics.  This includes games as well as various data or 3D visualization applications.

Sgine is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), which is a modern functional and object oriented language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine.  Because of this, Sgine can also be used for Java applications.
